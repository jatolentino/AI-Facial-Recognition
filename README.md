> Sample of one of my Web apps with AI

The goal of this project is to show up an application of a web app that provides a service of face recognition using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and which is served through a website.

## Use it on your localhost
---
### In the Backend
```bash
	virtualenv env
	source env/bin/activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python manage.py runserver
```
### In the Frontend
```bash
	npm i
	npm start
```
> Take in consideration that `npm i` takes some minutes.


As an initial approach to simulate the drone navigation, the softwares Octave or Matlab have been utilized to provide trajectories and compute the equations of the state-space model. Due to the high non-linearities of the plant, a novel control method is yet to be tested and possibly compared against traditional control algorithms.  

In the clip below, we conducted two test to demostrate that indeed, ML can enhance the tracking path, decreasing the overshoot at the very beginning.
